# This goes in you i3 config file
# bad apple specific
# Create a workspace var
set $wsba "Bad Apple"

# Mod key + b will switch to bad apple workspace & hide the i3 bar & hide all XTerm windows borders
bindsym $mod+b workspace $wsba; bar mode hide; [class="^XTerm$"] border none

# If you want this permanently in your config, you should add  "; bar mode dock" to each binding that switch workspace
# You should as well add a line restoring borders for XTerm, like this "; [class="^XTerm$"] border normal"
